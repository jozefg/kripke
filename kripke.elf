%{Kripke semantics are based around notions of ordered worlds. Since
  we only care about circle and box we have 3 worlds, forming a nice
  ordered chain. In theory we could leave the exact points in the
  world unspecified and just deal with them later but this turns into
  unnecessary pain because of limitations with Twelf.}%
